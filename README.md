# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation of the 2-D clock model of particle spins (with q=3). Written December 2018 as an optional assignment for Computational Physics 4G03 at McMaster Univeristy.

An example of the work I did in my computational physics classes during my undergrad in physics. I particularly enjoyed this project for how I made use of the class structure for my Monte Carlo simulation. 

The picture below is an example of the output when plotted using python's matplotlib library. The simulation produced a curve for the quantity Chi(X) that exhibited the expected phase transition around a temperature of 1.5 kT:
